# Exciting Update: Surveys Now Available!

Weâ€™re thrilled to announce a new feature: **support for surveys**! 

---

If a survey is available in the public domain for a cave system, it will now be displayed directly on the cave details page. This makes it easier than ever to explore and understand cave systems in greater detail.

For example, check out the survey for [Pen Park Hole](https://subterra.world/cave/mendips_pen-park-hole) and see this feature in action!

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to enhance your caving experience.
